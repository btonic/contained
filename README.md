# contained
A new take on containers.

## How it works
contained makes setting up Docker containers much easier. With contained, you only need to specify what you needs for your container to run are one time. contained will then take your requirements and then manage all communication between you and docker so you don't have to worry about remembering all the different flags and other annoying commands as much and instead focus on your actual goals. You shouldn't have to be fighting Docker just because you forgot one argument this one time you ran it.
